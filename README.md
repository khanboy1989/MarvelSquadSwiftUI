### This project is created by using MVVM-C pattern with full SwiftUI. It also contains Modular Architect & Clean Architect. 
### For presentation layer, I used MVVM-C. 

Supports: iOS 16+

This example has been developed by getting inspired from one of my previous job applications (not structure - only the context). The structure is taken from 
this repo: https://github.com/hoangatuan/iMovie (Thank to hoangatuan). 

## Key Features

- Presentation layer: SwiftUI + MVVM-C + Modern concurrency
- Clean architecture: Decoupled Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers
- Modular architecture
- Navigation using `NavigationStack`
- Dependency Injection using `CompositionRoot` approach, `DIContainer` & constructor injection to support testing.
- Designed for scalability. It can be used as a reference for building large production apps  

### Inovates üí°

- Use Swift Macros to remove duplicate codes

## Why MVVM but not TCA, Redux, ... ?

Please read [this great article](https://betterprogramming.pub/swiftui-choosing-an-application-architecture-6ec9289f8e8f) from @Michael Long. I pretty much agreed with his thoughts.
